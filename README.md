# calculator
Welcome to my calculator project! This is a fully-functioning calculator made using HTML, CSS, and JS.

It demonstrates the following:
-Effective use of CSS grid to format the shape of the calculator
-Understanding of how HTML, JS, and CSS work together to form one cohesive project
-Use of the DOM to select and manipulate elements
-Use of JS (especially switch statements) to add functionality

Functionality:
-All button clicks will add the correct input to the output box
-The AC button will clear the output box
-The DEL button will erase one character at a time
-The = button will evaluate the expression as seen in the output
-All standard math operations work as intended
-Use of word wrap allows the output box to take up as many lines as needed, without overflowing
-Output box updated with keypresses from the keyboard (4/1/22)

Features to be added:
-A previous and current number counter
-Additional buttons, such as '(', ')'
-Media Queries for screen sizes below a width of 450px

IMPORTANT:
-Improve DEL button functionality
